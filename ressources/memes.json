The highest followers swear on their lives of one in particular, of the mighty FEESH sacrificing FMOptimist, shared as the common tale to others in hopes of passing it on to future generations. To the outsider though, these followers appear insane, driven only by madness, spending each day patiently waiting for the day their god would return...",
